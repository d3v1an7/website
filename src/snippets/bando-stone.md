Childish Gambino's latest album, [Bando Stone and The New World](https://open.spotify.com/album/1jzqiffupvhniPZB4aBNEv) is a very Gambino ride, and comes close to topping [Because the Internet](https://open.spotify.com/album/62yjWIhnATHxPqGbgC9Lqr) for me. It's so diverse! The production is so good and weird!

There is a tiny sample from Undertale in the first track, which on the whole, reminds me of the opening of Yeezus. I've been whisting along to _Lithonia_ all week. The Prodigy sample in _Got To Be_ is perfect. Steve Lacy vibes on _Dadvocate_.

Check it out! Or don't! That's also fine.
