It was beautiful. I think about it often, and would do it again in a heartbeat.

The edit is a bit zoomy cause I was trying to fit 6 days worth of footage into a
single video. When I have a spare weekend, I'll probably do a day-by-day recut
and write up a blog to go with it.

But until then, please enjoy.
