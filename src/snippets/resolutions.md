My new year (tech) resolutions are to have some fun with:

- [**Devbox**](https://www.jetify.com/devbox) Can I replace Docker for my local dev environment?
- [**HTMLRewriter**](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/html-rewriter/) How much can I (or should I!?) mess with content on the edge?
- [**CUBE CSS**](https://cube.fyi/) Would this methodology be worth adopting? What problems does it solve?
- [**htmx**](https://htmx.org/) I'm very happy with static build + Alpine.js, what benefits would `htmx` provide?
- [**11ty docs**](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy/issues/3388) I dropped the ball on this last year. I'd like to make a meaningful contribution towards the docs this year.

What are your tech resolutions? [Let me know](https://infosec.exchange/@d3v1an7)!
