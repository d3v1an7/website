No, but really, _every single time_ I socialise what I'm thinking when writing or refactoring "important stuff", I get feedback that greatly improves clarity.

Today I started with:

- `paid_subscriber_list`
- `registered_user_list`

Fine I guess, technically correct, but it wasn't sitting quite right. So I threw it out there, and within 10 seconds we ended up with:

- `paid_user_list`
- `nonpaid_user_list`

Less ambiguity, more consistent verbage, chef kiss.
